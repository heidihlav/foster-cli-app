# Foster

Welcome to the CLI Foster gem!
The Foster app is a simple CLI (command line interface) gem in which users can look through a list of pets available for foster at a local animal shelter. Users can learn more about the pets by selecting the number by a pets' name, and reading a short prompt that gives a hyperlink to visit to read the pets' full biography.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'foster'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install foster

## Usage

Clone the repository and run "ruby bin/available_fosters". Follow the prompts in the command line application.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
